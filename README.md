# souther-native-compiler

Compiles a checked Souther program to a host-native object.

A behavior becomes a symbol in an object file the system linker takes, so the output runs where
there is no virtual machine and no wasm engine.

## What it reads

`CheckedProgram` and what is reachable from it, and nothing else of the Souther compiler. Anything
this needs that the program API does not carry is a question for Souther rather than something to
reach around, so it is raised there. This project is the second reader of that boundary, and what
it finds the boundary does not answer is the most useful thing it produces.

## The two halves

The Java half reads a checked program and writes it out. It decides nothing: the projection over
`Core` is exhaustive, so a node added to the language stops this compiling rather than travelling
as something else.

The Rust half reads that and lowers it to Cranelift IR, and Cranelift writes the object. The two
speak over a process boundary — what crosses is a program to compile and an object file, once per
build, so there is nothing here for an in-process call to make faster, and a panic on the Rust side
does not take a JVM with it.

## What is not shared with the wasm backend

The lowering is not, and neither is the representation. A value's layout, what a pointer is, and
how a call is made are what a target decides, and the two targets decide them differently. What the
two backends share is above them — the checked program — and, where the same computation turns out
to be written twice, below them in the Rust runtime. Nothing in the middle is shared, and no
abstraction over the two is written to make it look as though something is.

## Building

    mvn test

Cargo is what builds the Rust half; Maven runs it. The toolchain is pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`, so a clone needs rustup and nothing else installed by hand.
